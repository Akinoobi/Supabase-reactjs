This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, is to install packages 
```bash
npm install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser it will redirect to /books to see the result.
